Based off the web front-end that I amended for InguzDSP

Conceptual Design
custom.conf

Source -> Sox -> CamillaDSP -> Output

Source this will be the initial source and could be various rates and bit depth
Sox will be used to standardise the rate and bit depth. Initially this will be 24/96; but later will be configurable
CamillDSP this will be a barebones install of CamillDSP the yaml file will have the same id as the player and will be managed via the plugin scrpt
CamillaDSP will be configured with Stdin and Out both at 24/96, again this may be later configurable.
Output this step may not be necessary but will allow basic setup for the player.

Notes on behaviour
Initialise
The Plugin PM will
create a section in the custom.conf for a new player
create a default yaml file for a new player
optionally re-write the custom.conf if a key value changes

Change in value via UI
any change via the UI will directly update the players local copy of the YAML file.
the change will require the stream to be re-started
enhancement - it may be possible to poke the CamilladDSP web socket to make the change dynamic

Saving a preset
The Plugin PM will copy the players current yaml file to the Preset folder and change the name to the user supplied name

Loading a preset
The Plugin PM will copy the named yaml file and replace the players default file with it.
NB this process should not change the input and output sections and should only update filters etc

Convolution filter
in CamillaDSP wav/raw files need to be at the same bit depth and rate as the music playing any impulses loaded will be converted to the appropriate rate(s)
This will require suffixes to be appended to the file names.



Initialise
 Given  I first load the DSP page
 When I will read in all the Lists
 And I will read in all the data
 Then I will refresh all the list controls
 And I will refresh all the data values
 And I will refresh all the EQ values
 
 
Change Bands 
 Given I change the EQ Band
 When I Save the Number of Bands
 Then I will read in all the data
 And I will refresh all the EQ values
 
 
Load Preset
  Given I select a Preset
  When I save the Value
  And I copy the Preset to the Save Preset field
  Then I will read in all the data
  And I will refresh all the data values
  And I will refresh all the EQ values
   
  	
Save a Preset
  Given I save a preset
  When I save the Value
  Then I add the new Preset to the Dropdown
  Then I display a Save Message


Select a Filter
 Given I select a filter
 When I save the Value
 Then I display a Save Message

Change an EQ Band
 Given I have amended an EQ Band
 When I save the EQ Band 
 
 
 --------------------------
 replace -> onmousedown
 with --> onpointerdown
 
 Add in style formatting: below
 
 input[type=range] {
  pointer-events: none;
}

input[type=range]::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  pointer-events: auto;
}

input[type=range]::-moz-range-thumb {
  pointer-events: auto;
}

input[type=range]::-ms-thumb {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
