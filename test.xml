		<changes>
		  <change>0.1.06c - Reverted to my WAV file loader and re-wrote resampler, testng via REW and through audio showed this was more accurate that REW. Tuned Normailzation gain settings so that they are consistent
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.06a - Loudness fine tuning, Width Filter added. Some issues fixed, mainly resampling Impulse should be better.
		  </change>	
	
		  <change>0.1.05e - amended binary now using new simple internal DSP library, provides PEQ functions, resampler and basic convolver. Should be simpler to maintain and is faster.
		  </change>	
		  
		  <change>0.1.04c - amended binary so that faad processes don't hang.
		  </change>
