	  <changes>
	  <change>0.1.33 - Revised Binary, enhanced gapless cache. Tweaked preset save logic so that Last-Preset are corrected. </change>
	  <change>0.1.32 - Revised Binary, another gapless playback fix, Fixed gain drop. Tweaked preset load logic so that clientname, ID and Last-Preset are corrected. Amended dynamic application of amended settings so that it will only work if a track is playing.</change>
	  <change>0.1.31 - Fixed Gapless, Fixed aiff issue</change>
	  <change>0.1.30 - Revised UI for usabliltity - see wiki.</change>
	  <change>0.1.28 - Fixed issue where there is only a PEQ filter, then the checks for FIR filter cause early termination</change>
	  <change>0.1.27 - Fixed Error in binary where no filter selected exits early, when first convolver finishes as it tries to write tail file</change>
		<change>0.1.26 - Fixed Error in binary where no filter selected defaults to a filter with a single zero value sample, which if used will silence the output</change>
		<change>0.1.25 - Binary using sox for resampling, now that I have figured out the highest quality settings. Normaliser is based off FFT peak, as more accurate. Code tidy up. Transcoder, fixing issue with alc where the parameter order affects whether transcoding work</change>
	
	  	  <change>0.1.24 - Fixed issue with cleanup vs REW filters being wrong, Extended length of PEQ filter, minor corrections to  mp3, wmal, wav transcoder 
		  </change>
	  <change>0.1.23 - Disabling and activating filters now working properly, fir filters now windowed properly, binary shrunk, transcoder change for faad decoder
		  </change>
		<change>0.1.22 - file loader corrections so load of wav, pcm and aif is faster and more robust, convolver correction to signalblock size reduces latency. 
		Changes mean less stuttering and dropouts. Simplification and standardisation to transcoder now possible 
		  </change>
		<change>0.1.21 - performance improvements to binary now slight improvement on c# version on windows, much faster on linux
		  </change>
		  
		  <change>0.1.20 - complete re-write of DSP process in golang. changed converter template to work with this new version
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.11 - .net 9 enhanced binary compilation, improved impulse resampler normaliser with caching. Experimental OSX Arm64 native binary
		  </change>
		 
		  <change>0.1.10 - recompiled binary to .net 9. Initialised log file, better error handling for reading log files and presets. Fixed issue where a single Peak filter needed. Reading REW txt files fixed for shelves
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.09 - Fixed issues with dropdowns not showing previously selected items, cleaned up preset files and stopped chatty polling of TVs firing off initialisation code.
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.08 - Made changes to Custome-conv.conf : Spotty so that it can be cast, mp3 allows backwards skipping and aif now works.
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.07 - Amended settings so that settings folder is passed via the config file. This fixes issue for MacOS where original code did not work.
		  </change>
	
		  <change>0.1.06 - Reverted to my WAV file loader and re-wrote resampler, testng via REW and through audio showed this was more accurate that REW. Tuned Normailzation gain settings so that they are consistent, Loudness fine tuning, Width Filter added. Some issues fixed, mainly resampling Impulse should be better.
		  </change>	
	
		  <change>0.1.05 - amended binary now using new simple internal DSP library, provides PEQ functions, resampler and basic convolver. Should be simpler to maintain and is faster.
		  </change>	
		  
		  <change>0.1.04 - amended binary so that faad processes don't hang.
		  </change>	
		  <change>New Feature - Load PEQ settings from REW (Mono Only); Fixed issue with PEQ being added with odd defaults; Fixed intermittent issues resetting PEQ Bands; New Player has default Settings created on detection; Cosmetic changes; added editable outpied fields.
