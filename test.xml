			  <change>0.1.11 - .net 9 enhanced binary compilation, improved impulse resampler normaliser with caching. Experimental OSX Arm64 native binary
		  </change>
		 
		  <change>0.1.10 - recompiled binary to .net 9. Initialised log file, better error handling for reading log files and presets. Fixed issue where a single Peak filter needed. Reading REW txt files fixed for shelves
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.09 - Fixed issues with dropdowns not showing previously selected items, cleaned up preset files and stopped chatty polling of TVs firing off initialisation code.
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.08 - Made changes to Custome-conv.conf : Spotty so that it can be cast, mp3 allows backwards skipping and aif now works.
		  </change>
		  <change>0.1.07 - Amended settings so that settings folder is passed via the config file. This fixes issue for MacOS where original code did not work.
		  </change>
	
		  <change>0.1.06 - Reverted to my WAV file loader and re-wrote resampler, testng via REW and through audio showed this was more accurate that REW. Tuned Normailzation gain settings so that they are consistent, Loudness fine tuning, Width Filter added. Some issues fixed, mainly resampling Impulse should be better.
		  </change>	
	
		  <change>0.1.05 - amended binary now using new simple internal DSP library, provides PEQ functions, resampler and basic convolver. Should be simpler to maintain and is faster.
		  </change>	
		  
		  <change>0.1.04 - amended binary so that faad processes don't hang.
		  </change>	
		  <change>New Feature - Load PEQ settings from REW (Mono Only); Fixed issue with PEQ being added with odd defaults; Fixed intermittent issues resetting PEQ Bands; New Player has default Settings created on detection; Cosmetic changes; added editable outpied fields.
